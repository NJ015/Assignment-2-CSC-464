In this repo, you can find the required assignment  under Assignment_2_Trigram_Model, Next Word Recommender , nextwordrecommender in the templates file, and the model itself.
The other files are the advanced model we created by which:
      This version of the model and app caters to up to 5-grams, if it doesn't find the input 4-word key in the dictionary to predict the fifth, 
      it falls back and checks the last 3-words, and so on till we reach the last word predidicting a bigram and if that doesn't work too,
      the model outputs a "no prediction found" message.
